If you want to join me for a paddle there are a few things I ask

## Mindset

First of all come to learn, enjoy, and soak up the magic of being in a small boat powered by your own body.

If you haven't done it before be prepared to start off not being very good at it - and don't worry but be patient with yourself it comes with practice.

Be prepared to get wet. Accidental capsizes are rare - but the end of a session is a good time to practice "what happens if".

This way you learn some important skills - some to prevent a capsize and some to recover if one does happen.

Practising these skills in safe conditions is what makes it safe to go out.

## Team Spirit

When kayaking each person has their own boat - but it is critical that we all act as a team and look out for each other

Always try to make sure you are not too far ahead or behind the group, ask for help if you need it - and offer help readily to others.

## Responsibility

Kayaking comes with some risk. You need to accept that and take responsibility for your own actions.

At the beginning you may not have a full awareness of where the risks are - and as a qualified leader I will guide you following my training.

There is a balance to be struck - if I suggest something which you do not feel is safe you have a responsibility to say so and not to blindly follow.

On the other hand I may make a request of you for reasons of safety which you would need to follow - normally discussing this is fine - occasionally the discussion may have to happen later if the situation is urgent.

This is a balance we work together on - both leader and paddler having responsibilities.

## Kit

I don't have a supply of kit so you'll need to bring your own or organise to borrow some.

You will need

- a suitable boat
- spray deck (unless in a sit on top)
- a suitable paddle
- clothing for the conditions (considering water temperature)
- footwear (no bare feet)
- a buoyancy aid

Extra for covid-19

- a small waterproof person first aid kit
- hand sanitiser
