Lyme Bay Coastwatch have Lookouts at Burton Beach and Charmouth

> If you are afloat within the bay or walking on the coastline, we are here to do radio checks, give weather and tide information and keep an eye out for you. If you are near either of our lookouts (Hive Beach and Charmouth) do call in. If we have an ongoing incident, we shall tell you but we like to see you and to know if you are just practising eskimo rolls/cliff launches/net retrievals/skier-recovery, we are very happy to be told that and keep an eye out.
