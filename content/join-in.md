First of all come to learn, enjoy, and soak up the magic of being in a small boat powered by your own body.

Be prepared to get wet.

Look out for each other - everyone is in their own boat but we stay together and keep each other safe.

## Kit

I don't have a supply of kit so you'll need to bring your own or organise to borrow some.

You will need

- a suitable boat
- spray deck (unless in a sit on top)
- a suitable paddle
- clothing for the conditions (considering water temperature)
- footwear (no bare feet)
- a buoyancy aid
- drinking water

Extra for covid-19

- a small waterproof person first aid kit
- hand sanitiser
- maybe a face mask for onshore boat handling

## What makes a suitable boat ?

To go on the sea a kayak should be manageable in some wind and waves and be one you can get back in after a capsize.

The ideal craft for longer journeys and rougher weather is a sea kayak which has

- sealed compartments in front and behind so that it floats even if the cockpit is full of water
- decklines all around so that you can easily keep hold of it
- long narrow shape so that you can paddle efficiently (even against wind and wave)
- a skeg so that it will navigate well in windy conditions

A sit on top is also be a good choice - the main benefit is that you can get back on board after a capsize and paddle away - I paddled one for years and still do sometimes.

![Sit on Top Kayak](/images/sit-on-top.jpg)

Sit on tops are generally slower/harder to paddle than sea kayaks and are more affected by wind and wave.

Some sit on tops are too short to be used on the sea by beginners (shorter boats slower and turn more easily).

If you want to go fishing, or muck about with kids - they offer a stable platform. If you might go out alone it's much quicker to learn how to "self rescue" a sit on top than a sit in.

There are far more sit on top kayaks than sit ins for these reasons.

## Unsuitable boats

Whitewater kayaks

This is the aquatic equivalent of a BMX bike.

Intended for use on steep rivers or to do stunts.

On calm days, they are a slow, tiring, wet ride; they are uncontrollable in windy conditions. Hard to tow in an emergency, tending to turn sideways and then turn over.

Many have little room for flotation in the form of plastic foam or buoyancy bags and so are hard to rescue after a capsize while maintaining social distance.

Inflatable Kayak

Inflatables are quite light and often sit quite high off the water. This makes them perfect for weekend adventures and gentle paddling, but not so great for rapids, sea paddling, or places exposed to the elements. Keep your inflatable in their natural environment such as on canals, sheltered lakes and slow flow rivers.
