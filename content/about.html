<p>My name is Sean Burlington, I am a qualified Sea Kayak Leader, based in Bridport.</p>

<p>I have a passion for paddling kayaks on the sea along our magnificent coastline and want to share that passion by helping people develop their skills and just go for a paddle.</p>

<p>When I'm paddling I don't worry - I am in the moment.</p>

<p>It's a form of exercise that I find incredibly helpful in balancing out the amount of time I spend sitting down.</p>


<h2>Risk</h2>

<p>Kayaking involves some risk, you may well get a blister, sunburn, sore muscles, maybe a bruise, and almost certainly if you kayak on the sea enough - at some point you will get cold and wet.</p>

<p>Some people die kayaking. Not many each year but it does happen which is why I take safety very seriously to minimise any risk.</p>


<h2>Leading</h2>

<p>I have gained a <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/courses/sea-kayak-leader">Sea Kayak Leader</a> qualification from <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/">British Canoeing</a> (the national governing body for paddlesports in the UK) which is an award recognising an ability to lead up to 6 people in the following sea conditions (with some caveats). </p>

  Considerations for coaches and leaders

British Canoeing welcomes this development and has created this additional guidance to support British Canoeing Qualified Coaches and Leaders and encourages that members continue to check both the Government and British Canoeing websites on a regular basis for the latest information.

Qualified British Canoeing Coaches and Leaders have all undertaken specific training and a robust assessment and this provides confidence that qualified individuals have the appropriate experience, decision making skills and professional judgement to consider this guidance and take the appropriate measures to ensure the safety of paddlers. British Canoeing suggest that all qualified coaches, leaders and instructors should;

    Complete a thorough risk assessment for all activity, taking into consideration the government guidelines and put in place appropriate measures to safeguard the paddler, coach or leader and members of the public
    Consider the appropriate safety frameworks for the activity taking place, taking into account the capabilities of the individual paddler and the venue being used
    Within the risk assessment consider and put in place appropriate measures for safeguarding children, adults at risk and lone working
    Any coaching of under 18s and adults at risk on a 1:1 basis should be avoided. The relaxation of the government guidance on social gatherings now means that group coaching (up to 1:5) or individual coaching with parent/carer supervision can now take place. Coaches are reminded of the principles of British Canoeingâ€™s safeguarding policy.
    Develop appropriate approaches to ensure that social distancing restrictions are followed as part of the coaching or instruction including within any pre briefings and post feedback sessions
    Continually consider and take action to minimise the risk of infection/transmission, such as avoiding passing any equipment to the paddler or helping lift their craft
    Select venues and conditions where possible which are familiar to you and the paddler and to carry out continuous dynamic risk assessments
    Carry and wear appropriate safety equipment for you and the paddler. This may include buoyancy aids, a throwline, and a means to call for help and keep these available at all times
    Ensure a first aid kit is available and understand the changes in guidance during this COVID-19 period
    Avoid lending or borrowing any equipment, all equipment used by the paddler should be their own
    If parents or guardians from the same household are present during the session then social distancing restrictions must also be applied around them
    Ensure communication well in advance with the paddler, to make them aware of the measures being put in place for the session, and guidelines they should follow, before, during and after the session

You should also enforce strong hygiene measures. This might be cleaning any equipment rigorously in line with wider guidance on hygiene, for example by using antibacterial spray and washing hands thoroughly before and after use.
