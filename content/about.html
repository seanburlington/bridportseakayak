<p>My name is Sean Burlington, I am a qualified Sea Kayak Leader, based in Bridport.</p>

<p>I have a passion for paddling kayaks on the sea along our magnificent coastline and want to share that passion by helping people develop their skills and just go for a paddle.</p>

<p>When I'm paddling I don't worry - I am in the moment.</p>

<p>It's a form of exercise that I find incredibly helpful in balancing out the amount of time I spend sitting down.</p>


<h2>Risk</h2>

<p>I would describe myself as a cautious person - but I also belive that many of the risks we face in life are not always obvious and sometimes the worst thing is to risk not doing something.</p>

<p>Kayaking involves some risk, you may well get a blister, sunburn, sore muscles, maybe a bruise, and almost certainly if you kayak on the sea enough - at some point you will get cold and wet.</p>

<p>Some people die kayaking. Not many each year but it does happen: which is why I take safety very seriously to minimise any risk.</p>


<h2>Leading</h2>

<p>I have gained a <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/courses/sea-kayak-leader">Sea Kayak Leader</a> qualification from <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/">British Canoeing</a> (the national governing body for paddlesports in the UK) which is an award recognising an ability to lead up to 6 people in the following sea conditions (with some caveats). </p>
