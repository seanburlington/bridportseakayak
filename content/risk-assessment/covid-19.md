> Qualified British Canoeing Coaches and Leaders have all undertaken specific training and a robust assessment and this provides confidence that qualified individuals have the appropriate experience, decision making skills and professional judgement to consider this guidance and take the appropriate measures to ensure the safety of paddlers. British Canoeing suggest that all qualified coaches, leaders and instructors should;

- Complete a thorough risk assessment for all activity, taking into consideration the government guidelines and put in place appropriate measures to safeguard the paddler, coach or leader and members of the public
- Consider the appropriate safety frameworks for the activity taking place, taking into account the capabilities of the individual paddler and the venue being used
- Within the risk assessment consider and put in place appropriate measures for safeguarding children, adults at risk and lone working
- Any coaching of under 18s and adults at risk on a 1:1 basis should be avoided. The relaxation of the government guidance on social gatherings now means that group coaching (up to 1:5) or individual coaching with parent/carer supervision can now take place. Coaches are reminded of the principles of British Canoeingâ€™s safeguarding policy.
- Develop appropriate approaches to ensure that social distancing restrictions are followed as part of the coaching or instruction including within any pre briefings and post feedback sessions
- Continually consider and take action to minimise the risk of infection/transmission, such as avoiding passing any equipment to the paddler or helping lift their craft
- Select venues and conditions where possible which are familiar to you and the paddler and to carry out continuous dynamic risk assessments
- Carry and wear appropriate safety equipment for you and the paddler. This may include buoyancy aids, a throwline, and a means to call for help and keep these available at all times
- Ensure a first aid kit is available and understand the changes in guidance during this COVID-19 period
- Avoid lending or borrowing any equipment, all equipment used by the paddler should be their own
- If parents or guardians from the same household are present during the session then social distancing restrictions must also be applied around them
- Ensure communication well in advance with the paddler, to make them aware of the measures being put in place for the session, and guidelines they should follow, before, during and after the session

- You should also enforce strong hygiene measures. This might be cleaning any equipment rigorously in line with wider guidance on hygiene, for example by using antibacterial spray and washing hands thoroughly before and after use.
