The legal issues surrounding kayaking are complex, confusing, and surrounded by urban legend and a lot of misinformation.

Incidents in kayaking are infrequent but do happen.

Sometimes people die, there are inquests, and legal cases.

When you go kayaking you take on a certain amount of risk for yourself and a duty of care towards the group. When you lead a group you have additional responsibilities.

> The Duty of Care requires you to consider the consequences of your acts and omissions and to ensure that those acts and/or omissions do not give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury to any other person. Clearly, one is not expected to guarantee the safety of others, merely to act reasonably.
>
> In short, all of us owe a duty not to injure other people by our negligent acts and omissions and that is an individual duty which each of us owe all of the time to our ‘neighbours’.
>
> [_British Canoeing – Duty of care - Information Sheet_](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/uploads/documents/1-Duty-of-Care.pdf)

Because of the risks I have undertaking training and qualification, have familiarised myself with best practice and generally tried to stay well on the right side of being reasonable.

My understanding is this :

Firstly if we all follow safety guidelines and paddle within our abilities a serious incident is unlikely.

The most likely incidents are

- crashing your car on the way to or from the paddle
- hurting your back carrying your kayak
- tripping up on the shore
- broken glass on the beach
- blisters
- sunburn

Take care to avoid these (especially carrying your kayak - accept help if you need it) but at the same time if you are not prepared to accept some risk : don't paddle.

As a qualified Instructor and member of British Canoeing I have some [liability insurance](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/membership/why-join-british-canoeing/insurance-towergate)

If you [join British Canoeing](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/membership/join-us-online-here) one of the benefits you will gain is insurance.

This insurance covers for things like negligence and accidental damage.

As I understand it this insurance doesn't cover personal injury except where caused by negligence - if you want insurance of this sort and for loss of earnings it can be taken out and doesn't appear to be expensive.

As an example if we are out for a paddle at West Bay and when we return there is significant breaking surf on the beach if I were to tell a beginner "don't worry it'll be fine just head in" and that person was capsized, hit by a boat full of water, and consequently significantly injured - that person might well be able to sue for damages.

On the other hand if at the start of a session I have identified the surf conditions as challenging - warned of the risk - advised that it is only suitable for experienced paddlers, given suitable instruction on technique, and warned of the risks: an injury could still occur but the risk would have been accepted by the paddler and a legal demand for compensation would be unlikely to succeed.

I am not a lawyer - this is not legal advice.

This is just an attempt to explain: I want to share the joy of this activity - there is some risk to it. I don't want to get sued.

I believe that by following [British Canoeing Safety guidelines](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/guidance-resources/safety-1)

- Having a suitable qualification and following my training
- explaining the risks
- paddling within remit (sea/weather conditions)
- considering the ability of the group

This minimises the chance of an incident occurring.

If an incident does occur despite this it is unlikely I can be sued.
