These sessions are being run partly because I just want to share the joy of this fantastic sport.

Partly to support the community during lockdown when many people cannot enjoy their normal activities.

But also to support the RNLI - and give back a bit of the support that they give us every time we go out on the sea.

Coronavirus puts an added risk onto the lifeboat service - I hope to provide training to help people stay safe and at the same time raise some funds.

Sessions are free but I encourage participants to donate the the RNLI if they can
