## I ❤️ Kayaking

### I hope you will too

I fell in love with sea kayaking the moment I first tried it - I just adore the feeling of connection I get with the boat, the water, the waves, the peace and the views.

It took me a long time to build the confidence to really get out and enjoy it.

Having gained the experience one of the things I really want to do is to share this experience and help more people get out on the sea, maybe just enjoy an evenings paddle - but maybe with the aim to get enough experience and skill to paddle independently with friends.

The sea has risks and the [RNLI advise](https://rnli.org/safety/choose-your-activity/kayaking-and-canoeing#training) includes getting training

I can guide you on some local trips and provide tips on

- paddling technique
- safety kit (selection and use)
- understanding tide and weather as it affects kayakers
- suitable boats and equipment
- local knowledge of good landing spots

I am to paddle regularly on Wednesday evening at West Bay or nearby locations such as Portland Harbour, Charmouth,

I will lead occasional longer trips at weekends
