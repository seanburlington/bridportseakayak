I fell in love with sea kayaking the moment I first tried it.

It took me a long time to build the confidence to really get out and enjoy it.

Having gained skills myself one of the things I really want to do is to share this experience and help more people get out on the sea.

This is not part of a club, nor is it paid coaching.

What I'm hoping to do is to help nurture a community of independent kayakers around Bridport.

If you have a suitable boat and want to learn a bit more I can guide you on some local trips and provide tips on

- paddling technique
- safety kit (selection and use)
- understanding tide and weather as it affects kayakers
- local knowledge of good landing spots

This is new to me so plans will change as I learn what works and what people want.

Some people might just want one session, others might want a few.

I'm doing this for the love of it - no charge - donations to RNLI welcome but purely optional.
