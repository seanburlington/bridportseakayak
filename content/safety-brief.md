M.Y.A.B.C.D.E. stands for-

- Me – Introduction and a bit about me.
- You – Introductions from the group.
- Area – the plan for the day, the water we will be on, and the ‘type’ of trip we will be undertaking.
- Boats and kit – safety checks and also who has what kit and where.
- Communication – how will we communicate, what signals will we use.
- Doctor – an invitation for anyone to let me know any relevant medical needs and a reminder for people to carry any relevent medication.
- Emergency – what to do if an incident occurs – a swim brief and what the rest of the group should do.
