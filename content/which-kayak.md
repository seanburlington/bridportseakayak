If you're a beginner looking to buy a kayak for use on the sea the range is overwhelming.

If all you want to do is paddle a couple of times a year within easy swimming distance of shore in calm weather pretty much anything will do ([not inflatables though](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/48952463))

Assuming you want to paddle more regularly, paddle far enough to get some exercise, and still be able to get home if the wind picks up a bit then you need a longer boat.

Long boats go faster (this is a simplification) are less affected by the kinds of waves you're likely to meet, and are easier to paddle against tide and wind.

## Why speed matters

You may think that speed doesn't matter - you're not in a hurry or only want exercise.

Tidal flows around West bay run up to about 1 knot - maximum speed of a short kayak is 2 knots.

So if you paddle down tide you may be doing 3 knots over the ground but coming back against the tide only 1 knot. So that 1 hour trip out takes 3 hours, maybe 4 because you're getting tired ...

Take a faster boat that cruises at 3 knots and that same trip is now 4 knots out and 2 knots on the return - you still want to check the tides before you go but you're making much better headway.

That's just the tide and Lyme Bay is quite sheltered with gentle currents.

## Sit on tops

Sit ons are great - they have revolutionised and democratised kayaking making it accessible to far more people.

It's still worth learning some skills but the life saving feature of these boats is that it's fairly easy to get back on (do practice though - it needs some upper body strength and there is a knack)

## My choice

If I was in the market for a new sit on top there is only one model I'd choose.

It's fast, the sitting position is well suited to efficient paddling, the hull shape means it works well in waves - and it isn't expensive.

[RTM Tempo Standard](https://www.bournemouthcanoes.co.uk/rtm-kayaks.htm)

It's the same boat as the [fishing version](https://www.bournemouthcanoes.co.uk/productpages/rtm-kayaks/rtm-tempo-angler.htm) apart from colour, rod holders, and price.

A high visibility colour is an important safety consideration.

## Other good choices

The [Perception Triumph 13](https://www.bournemouthcanoes.co.uk/productpages/perception-kayaks/triumph.htm) is a bit flatter than the Tempo so feels more stable to a beginner - easier to get started with but you might outgrow it. A good boat that has some speed.

The [Wilderness Systems Tarpon 120](https://www.bournemouthcanoes.co.uk/productpages/wilderness-systems/tarpon-120.htm) is more geared as a fishing kayak - but faster than most of them.

## 12 feet / 4 Meters

Anything less than this and you either need to really know what you're doing (there are some great short surf kayaks) or stay in very sheltered locations with winds no more than Force 2 - preferably lifeguarded areas.

With a longer boat, some training, and with a friend or two: you can head further out, go around that headland, paddle against a breeze and generally have more fun.
